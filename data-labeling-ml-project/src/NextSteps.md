1. Data Exploration and Visualization:

Review Existing Plots: Use the plotting script you already have (process_data.py) to visually inspect your data. Look for patterns that consistently indicate the start and end of a jump. Identify which sensor data (accelerometer, gyroscope, etc.) seems most useful.
Interactive Plotting (Optional): Consider adding interactive features to your plotting script (e.g., using matplotlib.widgets) to zoom in on specific regions of the data and get a better sense of jump boundaries.

2. Labeling Tool Design:

UI Framework: Choose a UI framework for your labeling tool. Options include:
Matplotlib (Simple): Good for a quick, basic tool within your existing plotting environment. You can use mouse clicks to select timestamps. This is what you're currently using.
Tkinter (More Flexible): A standard Python GUI library. Allows for more complex UI elements (buttons, text boxes, etc.).
Web-based (Most Flexible): Use a framework like Flask or Django to create a web-based labeling tool. This allows for remote labeling and collaboration.
Data Loading: Your labeling tool needs to load the sensor data you want to label. Reuse your existing data loading functions from data_loader.py.
Plotting: Integrate your plotting code into the labeling tool. Display the relevant sensor data for the user to examine.
Timestamp Selection: Implement a mechanism for the user to select the start and end timestamps of a jump. This could be:
Clicking on the plot: Record the x-coordinate (timestamp) of mouse clicks.
Entering timestamps manually: Provide text boxes for the user to enter the timestamps.
Jump Storage: Store the start and end timestamps for each labeled jump. Use a data structure like a list of tuples: [(start_timestamp1, end_timestamp1), (start_timestamp2, end_timestamp2), ...]
Saving Labels: Implement a function to save the labeled data to a file. Use a format like:
JSON: Easy to read and parse.
CSV: Simple and widely compatible.
Custom Format: If you have specific requirements.
3. Labeling Tool Implementation:

Create a new Python file (e.g., labeling_tool.py).
Import necessary libraries (matplotlib, Tkinter, Flask, etc.).
Implement the UI, data loading, plotting, timestamp selection, jump storage, and saving functions.
Test the tool thoroughly.
4. Labeling Process:

Load a data file into the labeling tool.
Examine the sensor data plot.
Identify a jump.
Mark the start and end timestamps of the jump using your chosen method (clicking, manual entry, etc.).
Repeat steps 3 and 4 for all jumps in the data file.
Save the labeled data to a file.
Repeat steps 1-6 for all your data files.
5. Data Preparation for Training:

Load the labeled data.
Create training examples: For each jump, create a positive example consisting of the sensor data between the start and end timestamps. Also, create negative examples from data where there are no jumps.
Feature Engineering: Consider extracting features from the sensor data that might be useful for jump detection (e.g., rolling averages, standard deviations, peak detection, frequency domain analysis).
Split the data into training, validation, and test sets.
6. Model Training and Evaluation:

Choose a machine learning model: Suitable models for time-series classification include:
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs): Good for capturing temporal dependencies.
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks: A type of RNN that is better at handling long-range dependencies.
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): Can be used to extract features from the time-series data.
Support Vector Machines (SVMs): A classic machine learning algorithm that can be effective for classification.
Random Forests: An ensemble method that can be robust and easy to train.
Train the model on the training data.
Evaluate the model on the validation data and tune hyperparameters.
Evaluate the final model on the test data to estimate its performance on unseen data.
7. Iteration:

Analyze the model's performance: Identify areas where the model is making errors.
Collect more data: If necessary, collect more data to improve the model's performance.
Refine the labeling process: If you find that the labels are inconsistent, refine the labeling process to improve their quality.
Experiment with different features and models: Try different feature engineering techniques and machine learning models to see if you can improve the model's performance.
Example using your existing Matplotlib-based labeling tool:

Modify manual_labeler.py:
Add a function to load existing labels from a file (if any).
Modify the onclick function to store the start and end timestamps in a list.
Add a function to save the labels to a file (e.g., JSON).
Label your data: Run manual_labeler.py and label your data files.
Create a new script (prepare_data.py) to load the labeled data, create training examples, and split the data into training, validation, and test sets.
Create a new script (train_model.py) to train your chosen machine learning model.
